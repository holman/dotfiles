Assess technical debt and create a comprehensive remediation plan.

Technical Debt Analysis:
- Code quality issues and anti-patterns
- Architectural debt and design problems
- Test coverage gaps and quality issues
- Documentation deficiencies
- Outdated dependencies and libraries
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Accessibility compliance gaps
- Infrastructure and deployment inefficiencies

Assessment Criteria:
- Current impact on development velocity
- Risk to system stability and security
- Maintenance burden and complexity
- Future scalability implications
- Team productivity impact
- Business risk assessment

Remediation Planning:
- Prioritize debt by impact and effort
- Create phased remediation roadmap
- Estimate effort and resources needed
- Identify quick wins vs long-term investments
- Define success metrics
- Plan incremental improvements
- Minimize risk with gradual changes

Deliverables:
- Technical debt inventory with severity ratings
- Impact analysis (development velocity, quality, risk)
- Prioritized remediation roadmap
- Effort estimates for each item
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and tracking
- Team capacity recommendations

Consult with Master Architect for architectural debt and appropriate specialists for domain-specific issues.
