Conduct a thorough performance analysis and identify optimization opportunities.

Performance Assessment:
- Response time analysis (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput and concurrency evaluation
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, I/O)
- Database query performance
- API endpoint latency
- Frontend performance (Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size and load time analysis
- Memory leak detection
- N+1 query identification

Analysis Areas:
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Analyze caching opportunities
- Evaluate database indexing strategy
- Review connection pooling configuration
- Assess async processing opportunities
- Examine code-level optimization needs
- Review infrastructure scaling patterns

Deliverables:
- Performance baseline metrics
- Identified bottlenecks with severity assessment
- Optimization recommendations prioritized by impact
- Caching strategy (application, distributed, database, CDN)
- Database optimization suggestions
- Load testing plan
- Performance budget recommendations
- Monitoring and alerting configuration

Consult with Database Architect for query optimization and Deployment Engineer for infrastructure scaling.
