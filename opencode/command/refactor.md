Analyze the code and provide comprehensive refactoring recommendations.

Analysis Focus:
- Code smells and anti-patterns
- Complexity reduction opportunities
- Design pattern improvements
- Separation of concerns
- Code duplication elimination
- Naming and readability improvements
- Test coverage gaps
- Performance optimization opportunities

Provide:
- Current code analysis with identified issues
- Refactoring strategy and approach
- Step-by-step refactoring plan
- Before/after code examples
- Impact assessment (risk, effort, benefits)
- Testing strategy for refactored code
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Migration path if breaking changes

Consider:
- Maintain existing functionality (unless explicitly changing behavior)
- Minimize risk with incremental changes
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Document architectural improvements
- Balance perfection with pragmatism

Consult with Master Architect for significant architectural changes.
