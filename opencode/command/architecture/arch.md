Analyze the requirements and design a comprehensive system architecture.

Consider:
- Service boundaries and microservices decomposition
- Data flow and integration patterns
- Scalability and performance requirements
- Security architecture and compliance needs
- Technology stack recommendations
- Deployment and infrastructure patterns

Provide:
- Architecture diagrams (mermaid format)
- Component descriptions and responsibilities
- Technology recommendations with rationale
- Scalability considerations
- Potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices

Collaborate with Security Auditor, Performance Analyst, and Database Architect as needed.
