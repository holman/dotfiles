Conduct a thorough security audit and identify vulnerabilities.

Security Assessment:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
- Authentication and authorization review
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- CSRF protection implementation
- Secrets and credential management
- API security and rate limiting
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security header configuration
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)

Threat Analysis:
- Identify attack vectors and threat actors
- Assess exploitability and impact
- Perform threat modeling (STRIDE)
- Review security controls and defenses
- Evaluate compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

Deliverables:
- Risk assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Identified vulnerabilities with CVSS scores
- OWASP Top 10 mapping
- Compliance impact analysis
- Recommended security controls with implementation guidance
- Defense-in-depth strategy
- Remediation plan prioritized by severity
- Security testing recommendations

Provide specific, actionable remediation steps with code examples.
