- Team members (agents) involved
- Project context and scope

## Key Actions Recap
- Major decisions made
- Features implemented or designed
- Problems solved
- Code reviews completed
- Architecture decisions recorded
- Tests written or test strategies defined
- Documentation created
- Bugs fixed or investigated

## Session Metrics
- **Total conversation turns**: [Count of user-assistant exchanges]
- **Total session cost**: [API costs incurred]
- **Agents consulted**: [List of agents and frequency of use]
- **Files created/modified**: [Count and types]
- **Commands executed**: [List of commands used]
- **Lines of code**: [Approximate count if applicable]

## Efficiency Analysis
- **Velocity**: Tasks completed vs time spent
