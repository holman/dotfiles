# Architecture Agents

Specialized AI agents focused on system design, scalability, and technical architecture.

## Agents

### [Backend Architect](backend-architect.md)
Expert in API design, system scalability, microservices architecture, and backend infrastructure.

### [Database Architect](database-architect.md)
Specializes in schema design, query optimization, data modeling, and database performance.

### [System Architect](system-architect.md)
Focuses on overall system design, technology stack decisions, and integration patterns.

## Expertise Areas

- **System Design**: Scalable architecture patterns and best practices
- **API Architecture**: RESTful design, GraphQL, microservices
- **Database Design**: Schema optimization, indexing strategies, data modeling
- **Technology Selection**: Framework choices, infrastructure decisions
- **Performance Planning**: Scalability considerations, bottleneck analysis
- **Integration Patterns**: Service communication, data flow design

## Common Tasks

- Architecture review and recommendations
- System design documentation
- Technology stack evaluation
- Performance and scalability planning
- Integration strategy development
- Technical debt assessment

## Collaboration

Architecture agents often work with:
- **Engineering agents** for implementation details
- **Operations agents** for deployment and infrastructure
- **Quality agents** for architectural testing and validation
