# Wrapper script to invoke interactive emacs commands in a daemon instance.

# These days many people don't suspect it,
# but Emacs got server ('emacs' binary) and client ('emacsclient') parts.
# Launching server (i.e. default 'emacs' command) evaluates the config
# and could potentially take seconds if it's very heavy
# Launching the client however is lightning fast. It's just a matter of creating a window.

 # This trick gives you best of two worlds: if there is an Emacs daemon running,
 # it just connects to it. Otherwise, it spawns a daemon first and then connects to it.
 # Without this setting if you didn't have a daemon running, the command would fail.
 -a ''

 # open a new fram on the current terminal  
#  -nw
 # spawn new GUI window, otherwise it tries to launch client in terminal
 --create-frame 
 --frame-parameters="'(fullscreen . maximized)"

#   # process rest of arguments as elisp code
#  --eval
#   # bring focus to the window
#  '(select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame))'
)

# without any extra args it just invokes the daemon instance, otherwise executes the args
exec emacsclient "${ARGS[@]}" \
                 "$@"          # pass through whatever else you are trying to run
