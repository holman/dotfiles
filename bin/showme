# SHOW ME
# Takes X pictures of you via your iSight, animates them, uploads them to CloudApp, and puts
# the url in your clipboard
#
# https://gist.github.com/832125
#
# This uses a bunch of projects to make the magic happen, mostly thanks 
# to Zach Holman: http://github.com/holman
#
#
# required software:
#
# ImageMagick
# CloudApp - http://www.getcloudapp.com/
# cloudapp script: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/cloudapp
# gifme script: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gifme
#
# Make sure each of those are set up correctly
#
# isightcapture - http://www.intergalactic.de/pages/iSight.html
# download isightcapture and put it in your path
#
# Now you can take X shots from your iSight and push them to the clowd
#
# Ex: $ showme <num>
