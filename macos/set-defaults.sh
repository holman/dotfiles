# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Disable press-and-hold for keys in favor of key repeat.
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

# Always open everything in Finder's list view. This is important.
defaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle Nlsv

# Show the ~/Library folder.
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# Set a really fast key repeat.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1

# Set the Finder prefs for showing a few different volumes on the Desktop.
