# Sets reasonable macOS defaults.
#
# Or, in other words, set shit how I like in macOS.
#
# The original idea (and a couple settings) were grabbed from:
#   https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos
#
# Run ./set-defaults.sh and you'll be good to go.

# Always open everything in Finder's list view. This is important.
defaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle Nlsv

# Set a really fast key repeat.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1

# Set the Finder prefs to show all hidden files by default
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
