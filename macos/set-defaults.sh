# Always open everything in Finder's column view.
defaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle clmv

# Show the ~/Library folder.
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# Set the Finder prefs for showing a few different volumes on the Desktop.
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowExternalHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool true
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowRemovableMediaOnDesktop -bool true

# Run the screensaver if we're in the bottom-left hot corner.
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-corner -int 5
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-bl-modifier -int 0
