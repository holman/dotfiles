# Setup new machine from scratch

## manual installations
chrome

## rsync files
clean up old home directory, check for anything new to exclude, then:
`./.dotfiles/macos/sync_new_cp.sh`
~/Library/Exodus
~/Library/Duplicati

## settings
keyboard->modifer keys->caps-lock = ctrl
sound->play sound on startup off

## setup with dotfiles
clone dotfiles repo
`./.dotfiles/script/bootstrap`

## brew install
Set up admin and standard user to be members of same group:
https://medium.com/@leifhanack/homebrew-multi-user-setup-e10cb5849d59
From admin account do:
`brew bundle --file homebrew/Brewfile`  
since I think homebrew needs sudo to write to /Applications/

## mail backup
In Mail App:
link google account
Download attachments: all

## keychain
I didn't do this for new setup in June 2021 but you can:
```
scp ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db NEWCP:~/Library/Keychains/oldlogin.keychain-db
```
then in keychain app; `file->Add Keychain`; drag and drop anything you want to keep.

## time machine (AFTER rsync)

June 2020:
Only excluded:
    `~/Desktop` 
    `~/Downloads` 
    `~/temp`
    `~/Library/Application Support/Steam`
    `~/Documents/Encypted/prviate`
    `~/Documents/Encypted/prviate.gpg`
Included all system directories for easy restore. I held down Cmd-Shift when selecting 
exclusions, which gave an option to see hidden directories, but /usr (Homebrew) was 
grayed out so didn't exclude it.

Earlier:

```
sudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME
sudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/DISKNAME
sudo tmutil associatedisk -a / /Volumes/DISKNAME/Backups.backupdb/COMPUTERNAME/Latest/Macintosh\ HD
```
better to manually set exclusions while viewing old exclusions since there is 
no obvious way to dump these. There is an option to show hidden files during 
exclusion. Best to exclude repo `.git` and data folders, `Desktop`, `Downloads`
`temp`; drag `/System` to exclude all system files; `/usr` to ensure homebrew
files are not backed up.

## duplicati (AFTER rsync)
On old machine turn off duplicati on startup: Users & Groups -> Login Items
copy `~/.config/Duplicati` to new machine and open duplicati.

# Setup machine from time machine backup
You don't back up system files so don't do system restore:  
- use migration assistant to restore files and computer settings
- `./.dotfiles/bootstrap`
- `brew bundle --file homebrew/Brewfile`  
- git clone hwpl (since data/ and .git are not backed up)  
- set iterm shell to ...
