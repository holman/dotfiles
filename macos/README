better to manually set exclusions while viewing old exclusions since there is 
no obvious way to dump these. There is an option to show hidden files during 
exclusion. Best to exclude repo `.git` and data folders, `Desktop`, `Downloads`
`temp`; drag `/System` to exclude all system files; `/usr` to ensure homebrew
files are not backed up.
