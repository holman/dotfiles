This plugin provides a wrapper around the "wakeonlan" tool available from most
distributions' package repositories, or from the following website:

http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/software/wakeonlan/

In order to use this wrapper, create the ~/.wakeonlan directory, and place in
that directory one file for each device you would like to be able to wake. Give
the file a name that describes the device, such as its hostname. Each file
should contain a line with the mac address of the target device and the network
broadcast address.

For instance, there might be a file ~/.wakeonlan/leto with the following
contents:

00:11:22:33:44:55:66 192.168.0.255

To wake that device, use the following command:

# wake leto

The available device names will be autocompleted, so:

# wake <tab>

...will suggest "leto", along with any other configuration files that were
placed in the ~/.wakeonlan directory.

For more information regarding the configuration file format, check the
wakeonlan man page.
