LICENSE Libraries and external dependencies

SublimeREPL is not a monolithic block of code and some REPLs / functions depends on external libraries.

This means that, although the parts of SublimeREPL that I (wuub) wrote are published under BSD license and you're free to reuse them as you wish, the whole SublimeREPL package is as of now licensed under GPLv2.
