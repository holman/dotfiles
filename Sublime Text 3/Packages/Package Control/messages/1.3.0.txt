Package Control 1.3.0 Changelog:

Please be sure to restart Sublime Text 2 to start using this new version.

New Features
 - Added tracking of usage (install, upgrade, remove) statistics. Go to
   Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User and
   set the key "submit_usage" to false.

 - Added local tracking of installed packages in
   User/Package Control.sublime-settings via the "installed_packages" key.
   This allows distributing a settings file that will automatically install
   packages.

 - repositories.json schema version was increased to 1.1 and the
   "last_modified" key was added.
