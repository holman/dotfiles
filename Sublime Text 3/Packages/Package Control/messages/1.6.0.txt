Package Control 1.6.0 Changelog:

Wow! It has been 9 months since the last stable release of Package Control.
Quite a lot has happened since then, including the release of Sublime Text 2
stable, and hundreds upon hundreds of new packages from the community!

A quick thank you to Kevin Yank (@sentience) for recently volunteering to help
review packages for inclusion in the default channel, and ninj0x
(https://github.com/ninj0x) for rewriting the Package Control Community
Packages search functionality so it is nice and fast once again! The lists
below include specific thanks for code contributions.

As Sublime Text has become increasingly more popular, and the number of
packages has increased so rapidly, the bandwidth requirements have also
significantly increased. This month the default channel will very likely serve
over 1TB of JSON data. If you feel so inclined, consider pitching in a small
amount to help cover the cost:

to all of the users who have already contributed!


Enhancements


 - Added full (custom) proxy authentication support for HTTPS connections

 - Added NTLM authentication for proxies on Windows

 - Proxy authentication information is now set via the new proxy_username and
   proxy_password settings.

 - If the https_proxy setting it set to false, it will not inherit from the
   http_proxy setting (thanks planardothum!)

 - The time of the last successful run is no longer stored in
   Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings, but rather in
   Packages/User/Package Control.last-run making it easier to ignore via git,
   hg, etc. (thanks schlamar!)

 - Packages are now ignored during install and upgrade to help prevents errors
   where Sublime Text tries to read a file as it is being extracted

 - Packages that include DLLs for Windows can now be upgraded. In-use
   DLLs will be detected and the user prompted to restart.

 - Package version numbers may now include non-numeric components, and semantic
   versioning (http://semver.org) is fully supported

 - JSON parsing messages are now printed to the console instead of being shown
   in an error popup

 - Added support for changes to the BitBucket API

 - Added support for changes to GitHub URLs

 - Added the debug setting to help track down HTTP connection issues

 - All of the downloaders will now try to use HTTP compression

 - All of the downloaders will now follow redirects

 - Added new install_missing setting to control if Package Control should try
   to install any packages that appear to be missing from the current machine.
   This defaults to true, and is really only useful if you want to prevent
   Package Control from connecting to the internet without explicitly asking
   it to.

 - Added lots of code comments as a first step towards making contributions
   by other developers easier


Bug Fixes


 - Added support for the new preferences filename (thanks titoBouzout!)

 - If a package is missing from a machine, but not available for that
   platform, it is no longer considered an error (thanks schlamar!)

 - Updated CA certs

 - Fixed handling of install and upgrade messages that contain non-ASCII
   characters

 - Fixed a unicode error trying to load the CA cert bundle file on Windows when
   the install path to Sublime Text contains non-ASCII characters

 - Better handling for edge case HTTP errors (thanks tgecho!)

 - Fixed a number of errors related to non-ASCII error messages being created
   by the operating system (thanks quarnster!)

 - GitHub URLs will now automatically be trimmed of trailing .git suffixes

 - Badly formatted messages.json files will no longer break the install process
