- [ ] Analyze the install script and report on optimizations that can be made. Save it in a md file at the root.
- [ ] Think through the symlink configuration and how we can better use it to avoid copying files to other directories. I'd like to simply fetch the latest for this dotfiles repo and have all of my apps get the latest rather than needing to run the install again. Save this in another md report file, not making any changes yet.
