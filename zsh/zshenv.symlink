# From the docs:
#
# `.zshenv' is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless
# the -f option is set. It should contain commands to set the
# command search path, plus other important environment
# variables. `.zshenv' should not contain commands that produce
# output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# One example where this is useful is setting up 
# aliases to work with Vim
