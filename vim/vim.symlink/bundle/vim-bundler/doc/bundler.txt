INTRODUCTION                                    *bundler*

This lightweight companion to rails.vim and rake.vim provides support for
Bundler.  In addition to the below commands, it also syntax highlights
Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, and alters 'path' and 'tags' to include bundled
gems.  I recommend gem-ctags for generating tags for your gems.

COMMANDS                                        *bundler-commands*

                                                *bundler-:Bundle*
:Bundle[!] [args]       Invoke `bundle` via |:make|.


                                                *bundler-:Bopen*
:Bopen[!] [gem]         With no argument, edits the Gemfile.  Otherwise,
                        effectively does a `bundle open` of a gem inside of
                        Vim, including an |:lcd| to the gem's root directory.
                        Add ! to discard the current buffer's changes.

                                                *bundler-:Bedit*
:Bedit[!] [gem]         Like |:Bopen|, but don't |:lcd| afterwards.

                                                *bundler-:Bsplit*
:Bsplit[!] [gem]        Like |:Bopen|, but horizontally split.  Add ! to
                        suppress the |:lcd|.

                                                *bundler-:Bvsplit*
:Bvsplit[!] [gem]       Like |:Bopen|, but vertically split.  Add ! to
                        suppress the |:lcd|.

                                                *bundler-:Btabedit*
:Btabedit[!] [gem]      Like |:Bopen|, but use a new tab.  Add ! to
                        suppress the |:lcd|.

                                                *bundler-:Bpedit*
:Bpedit[!] [gem]        Like |:Bopen|, but use a preview window.  Add ! to
                        suppress the |:lcd|.

API                                             *bundler-api*

Use bundler#project(root) to retrieve an object for the project at the given
root path.  If no path is given, the current buffer's project root is used.
An empty object is returned if no project is found.  Use |empty()| to check
for that.

On the bundler#project() object, versions() returns a dictionary mapping
between gem names and their locked versions, paths() returns a dictionary
mapping between gem names and their installation path (omitting gems which
aren't installed), and has(gem) returns true if the given gem name is in the
bundle (regardless of whether or not it is installed).

The original data structures are returned for performance reasons.  Do not
mutate.
