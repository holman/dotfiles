                                                              *unicode-plugin*
1. Functionality

The plugins main purpose is to make handling unicode data and digraphs more
easily. It serves 3 main purposes:

    1) Complete Characters
       This plugin provides a custom completion function to complete unicode
       characters using their name or Codepoint value. If a digraph exists for
       that character, it will be displayed in paranthesis. This is (by
       default) activated by pressing Ctrl-X Ctrl-Z (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-Z|) in
       insert mode.

       Additionally it provides a completion function for digraphs. This is
       (by default) activated by pressing Ctrl-X Ctrl-G (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-G|) in
       insert mode.

    2) Identify Characters
       This plugin provides the |:UnicodeName| function to identify the
       character under the cursor similar to the builtin command |ga|. The
       |:SearchUnicode| command can be used to search for a unicode character
       with a given name or value.

    3) Ease the use of digraphs
       Use the |:Digraphs| command to search for a digraph with a given name
       or value (or simply display all available digraphs similar to how the
       |:digraph| command works. By default it also maps the <F4> key (in
       |Operator-pending-mode| and |Visual| mode) to transform 2 given
       characters into their corresponding digraph value.

The unicode.vim Plugin uses the data available from the Unicode
Consortium's website (http://www.unicode.org) to let you enter Unicode
characters using a completion function.

By default, the plugin creates a directory unicode below the path autoload
where this plugin is located. Within this directory it will store  the file
UnicodeData.txt from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt
which it will try to download using |netrw| . If this is unsuccessfull, or
you do not have |netrw| enabled, dowload the file manually and save it in the
unicode directory below the autoload directory in which unicode.vim is
located.
                                                     *unicode-plugin-error*
If the plugin gives an error or does not complete anything, first check, that
UnicodeData.txt from the Unicode Consortium has been successfully downloaded.
It should be located below the autoload/unicode.vim script in a directory
called unicode. So if you have installed unicode.vim into
/home/user/.vim, UnicodeData.txt should be located at:
/home/user/.vim/autoload/unicode/UnicodeData.txt (after the plugin has been
first used, it automatically creates a cache file of that data in the same
directory called UnicodeData.vim, which can be safely removed, it will be
recreated the next time this plugin is used) and should look like this:

0020;SPACE;Zs;0;WS;;;;;N;;;;;
0021;EXCLAMATION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0022;QUOTATION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0023;NUMBER SIGN;Po;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0024;DOLLAR SIGN;Sc;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0025;PERCENT SIGN;Po;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0026;AMPERSAND;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0027;APOSTROPHE;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;APOSTROPHE-QUOTE;;;;
0028;LEFT PARENTHESIS;Ps;0;ON;;;;;Y;OPENING PARENTHESIS;;;;
0029;RIGHT PARENTHESIS;Pe;0;ON;;;;;Y;CLOSING PARENTHESIS;;;;
[...]
(several thounsand lines following)

If the file looks correct, and the plugin is still not working correctly
contact the maintainer. You'll find my email-adress in the third line of this
document. Please be patient, it might take a while, until I can take care of
your report.

==============================================================================
2. Commands                                                 *unicode-commands*
                                                            *:UnicodeName*
Suppose, you want to know, what the Unicode Name for the Character under the
cursor is. You simply enter the ex command: >

    :UnicodeName [reg]

The plugin will then output the character, the character's hexadecimal value
and the official Unicode name.

Additionally, if there exists a digraph for that character, it will also be
shown in paranthesis (in case of several digraphs for that character, all
will be shown, separated by comma).

If you specify a register name, the message will also be saved into that
register.
								*:Digraphs*
    :Digraphs

Outputs the digraph list in an easier way to read with coloring of the
digraphs.

If you want to display a list with a line break after each digraph, use the
bang attribute >

    :Digraphs!

And if you want to display all digraphs matching a certain value, you can add
an argument to the command: >

    :Digraphs! A

displays all digraphs, that match 'A' (e.g. all that can be created with the
letter A or whose digraph matches the letter 'A'.)

If you know the name, you can also search for the unicode name:

    :Digraphs copy

will display all Digraphs, where their unicode name contains the word "copy"
(e.g. copyright symbol). Case is ignored. Note, you need at least to enter 2
characters.
							    *:SearchUnicode*
    :SearchUnicode [name|nr]

Outputs a list of unicode characters whose decimal value equals <nr> (use U+
or 0x prefix to search using hexadecimal values) or whose name matches the
given name (can be a regular expression). (Matching is done with the case
being ignored.) If possible, digraphs chars are displayed in (), separated by
commas and html entitities are displayed as well. Note, depending on your
search term, this might be a little bit slow.
							    *:UnicodeTable*
    :UnicodeTable

Creates a new window with a table of all Unicode characters.

							    *:DownloadUnicode*
    :DownloadUnicode

Downloads the Unicode data. Can also be used to update the local data file.

==============================================================================
3. Completing Functions
                                        *i_CTRL-X_CTRL-Z* *unicode-completion*
3.1 Completing Unicode Characters
---------------------------------

CTRL-X CTRL-Z           Search for the character in front of the cursor and
                        try to complete this letter using unicode names or
			values. If there is no letter in front of the cursor,
			a list with all available unicode characters is shown
			in a popup menu.
			(should have been <C-X><C-U> but this is used for user
			defined completions, so Z was chosen, since it is
			right next to it.)
       CTRL-N           Use next match. This match replaces the previous
                        match.
       CTRL-P           Use previous match. This match replaces the previous
                        one.

There are 2 possibilities to use the plugin. You can either enter the Unicode
Character name, or enter the Unicode-Codeposition.

For example, you would like to enter Æ, so you enter AE and press |<C-X><C-Z>|
while in insert mode. Alternatively you can enter the Unicode-Codepoint: U+C6
and press |<C-X><C-Z>| and the popup menu will show you all characters, that
have a codepoint like C6 with leading zeros, eg. U+00C6 and U+0C66

A popup menu will appear, showing you the Unicode-Codeposition value, the
Unicode Character Name and the Unicode Character (and if you have enabled it,
it can also show you the digraph characters needed to create this character in
paranthesis, see |unicode-plugin-config|). You can scroll down in the menu by
pressing <C-N> and up by pressing <C-P>.

A |preview-window| can be opened, if your Vim was compiled with the
quickfix-feature that displays the hexadecimal Unicode Codepoint, the name,
the digraph characters in parenthesis (if they exist) followed by the glyph
itself by setting the variable g:Unicode_ShowPreviewWindow (see below). By
default, this feature is off.

Note: If completing takes longer than 2 seconds (e.g. because many unicode
names match), you will be notified and completing further items will be
stopped so you can only complete the so far matched unicode chars.

                                                    *unicode-plugin-config*
If you would like to specify a different URL from which to download
UnicodeData.txt, enter the URL as: >

    :let g:Unicode_URL='http:....'

To force downloading the file from that new url, enter >

    :DownloadUnicode

You can also use this command to update your local unicode data file.

If you only want to complete the Unicode Names instead of the glyphs,
you can either set the global variable >

    let g:Unicode_CompleteName = 1
<
or you can use the mapping <leader>un which swaps the completion function
between completing the unicode name and completing the unicode glyph.

If you want the completion of the unicode chars to be opened in the preview
window, set the variable >

    let g:Unicode_ShowPreviewWindow = 1
<
in your |.vimrc|.

                                        *i_CTRL-X_CTRL-G* *digraph-completion*
3.2 Completing Digraphs
-----------------------

CTRL-X CTRL-G           Search for the character in front of the cursor and
                        try to complete this letter using a digraph. If there
                        is no letter in front of the cursor, a list with all
                        available digraphs is shown in a popup menu.
                        If both letters in front of the cursor form a digraph,
                        that digraph will be completed.
                        (Think of Glyph)
       CTRL-N           Use next match. This match replaces the previous
                        match.
       CTRL-P           Use previous match. This match replaces the previous
                        one.

==============================================================================
4. Mappings						*unicode-mappings*

The unicode plugin provides those mappings:

Key		Mode		Function
<C-X><C-Z>	Insert		Complete Unicode Name before cursor |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-G|
<C-X><C-G>	Insert		Complete Digraph before cursor |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-Z|
<F4>		Normal/Visual   Generate Digraph from chars |<Plug>(MakeDigraph)|
<Leader>un	Normal		Toggle Completion of Unicode Names and Chars

To remap those mappings to different keys see below.

                                                        *<Plug>(MakeDigraph)*
The plugin sets up a map to <F4>, for easier generation of digraphs. This
allows you to enter the digraph base characters and let the plugin convert a
certain range to its corresponding digraphs. Consider this line: >

    a:e:o:u:1Sß/\
<
Now put the cursor on the first char, press <f4> and hit '$'. The result will
look like this: >

    äëöü¹ß×

Note, that all pairs of base characters have been converted to their
corresponding digraph, leaving chars, that don't form a digraph alone (the
'ß')

If you like to change the default map, put a line like this into your |.vimrc|
>
    nnoremap <f2> <Plug>(MakeDigraph)
<
Now, the <f2> can be used to generate digraphs from their pairs. This is
done using an 'opfunc'-mapping (see |:map-operator|).

                                                        *<Plug>(UnicodeGA)*
The unicode plugin can be used to make the |ga| command more useful. If you
like to do this, then simply map the ga command like this in your |.vimrc| >

    nnoremap ga <Plug>(UnicodeGA)

This will invoke the |:UnicodeName| command whenever the ga command is used.

					*<Plug>(UnicodeSwapCompleteName)*
Instead of completing to the actual glyphs, the plugin can also complete
unicode names. Use the <Plug>(UnicodeSwapCompleteName) to toggle between both
completion types. By default, this is mapped to <Leader>un
==============================================================================
5. Public functions					*unicode-functions*

The unicode plugins also makes some functions publicly available, so you can
use it, if you want to write your own VimScript and need to handle unicode.

These functions are available:

unicode#FindUnicodeBy({match}])			*unicode#FindUnicodeBy()*
	Searches the unicode data for {match} and returns a list of dicts,
	each dict representing one dict. The dict can have the following
	keys:
		"name"	Unicode name
		"glyph"	Unicode Codepoint
		"dec"	Unicode Codepoint decimal value
		"hex"	Unicode Codepoint hex value
		"dig"	Digraph, to output this Unicode codepoint
			in Vim (see |i_CTRL-K|) (If there
			exists several digraphs, they will be separated
			by a space). This key is optional.
		"html"	Html entity to create this Unicode Codepoint.

	{match} can be a regular expression or a decimal or hex value (in
	which case the unicode characters will be searched for their
	decimal/hex values). Use the prefix "0x" or "U+" to force searching
	for that particular hex value. If {match} is an expression, it will
	be matched against the charactername (and case will be ignored).
			    
unicode#FindDigraphBy({match})			   *unicode#FindDigraphBy()*
	Searches the digraphs for {match} and returns a list of dicts for
	each match. The dict can have the following keys:
		"name"	Unicode name
		"glyph"	Unicode Codepoint
		"dec"	Unicode Codepoint decimal value
		"hex"	Unicode Codepoint hex value
		"dig"	Digraph, to output this Unicode codepoint
			in Vim (see |i_CTRL-K|) (If there exists
			several digraphs, they will be separated
			by a space). This key is optional.
		"html"	Html entity to create this Unicode Codepoint.

	{match} can be a regular expression or a decimal or hex value (in
	which case the unicode characters will be searched for their
	decimal/hex values). Use the prefix "0x" to force searching for that
	particular hex value. If {match} is an expression, it will be matched
	against the charactername (and case will be ignored).

unicode#Digraph({char1},{char2})		   *unicode#Digraph()*
	returns the digraph of {char1} and {char2}. If it is not valid,
	returns en empty string.

unicode#UnicodeName({val})			 *unicode#UnicodeName()*
	returns the unicode name of the character with the decimal value {val}

                        - |:UnicodeName| now displays the hexadecimal Unicode
                          Codepoint instead of the decimal one (as this seems
                          to be the official way to display unicode
                          codepoints).
