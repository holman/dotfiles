INTRODUCTION					*neosnippet-introduction*

*neosnippet* offers functionality similar to snipMate.vim or snippetsEmu.vim.
This analyzes snippet files which you can use for the completion.  Since you
can choose snippets with the neocomplcache/neocomplete interface, you might
have less trouble using them, because you do not have to remember each snippet
name.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*neosnippet-install*

1: Extract the file and put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/ or Program Files/Vim/vimfiles on Windows).

Note: If you want to complete snippets, you must install either neocomplcache
(https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim) or neocomplete
(https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim). It's not required, but highly
recommended.

Default snippets files are available in neosnippet-snippets.
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet-snippets

Note: Installing the default snippets is optional. If you choose not to install
them, you must set |g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets|. >
		let g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets = {
		\   '_' : 1,
		\ }

Extra snippets files are also available. e.g.:
https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets

Note: To enable context-filetype feature, you must install
context_filetype.vim. This allows you to use snippets not only depend on the
current 'filetype' of the file, but also depends on the cursor location, such
as javascript inside html, or lua inside Vim scripts.
https://github.com/Shougo/context_filetype.vim

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*neosnippet-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neosnippet-commands*

						*:NeoSnippetMakeCache*
:NeoSnippetMakeCache [filetype]
		Creates a cache for the snippets of the given [filetype]. It
		automatically chooses the current buffer's file type unless you
		specify another one by [filetype].

					*:NeoSnippetEdit*
:NeoSnippetEdit [{options}] [filetype]
		Opens the snippets for a given [filetype] to edit. It automatically
		selects the current buffer's filetype unless you specify
		another one by [filetype].

		If the path to [filetype] snippets is a directory, it
		automatically selects "[filetype].snip" in the [filetype]
		subdirectory.

		It edits a snippet file in |g:neosnippet#snippets_directory|
		with precedence. The snippets are re-cached automatically
		when you save the file after edit.

		The following parameters can be used as {options} to modify
		the behavior of the command. Note: You must escape spaces with
		a backslash "\".

					*neosnippet-edit-options-vertical*
		-vertical
		Split the window vertically.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-horizontal*
		-horizontal
		Split the window horizontally.

		Note: The behavior is undefined when both options are set.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-direction*
		-direction={direction}
		Define the split position rule. The default value is
		"belowleft".

					*neosnippet-edit-options-split*
		-split
		Split the buffer.

					*neosnippet-edit-options-runtime*
		-runtime
		Edit the runtime snippets (built-in defaults) instead of the
		user snippets defined by 'g:neosnippet#snippets_directory'.

							*:NeoSnippetSource*
:NeoSnippetSource [filename]
		Load the snippets of a [filetype].
		Note: The loaded snippets are enabled in current buffer only.

						*:NeoSnippetClearMarkers*
:NeoSnippetClearMarkers
		Clear current markers.
		Note: If you delete markers, you cannot jump to next
		placeholder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*neosnippet-variables*

g:neosnippet#snippets_directory		*g:neosnippet#snippets_directory*
		This variable appoints a path to user-defined snippet files.
		You can set multiple values in comma-separated string or list.
		Non existing directories are ignored.

		User defined snippet files are read after the built-in snippet
		files. If redundant snippets occur they get overwritten and
		only the last one remains.

		Note: The neosnippet plug-in loads file type snippets from
		several files if available. For example if you edit a "Vim"
		file it loads the snippets from:

		- "vim.snip*"
		- "vim_*.snip*"
		- "vim/**/*.snip"

		The default value is ''.

				*g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings*
g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings
		This variable disables key-mappings in |Select-mode| where the
		neosnippet performs the snippet completion. Usually it is
		better to leave it as it is. But if you have troubles with the
		buffer switcher LustyJuggler you can switch them off.

		The default value is 1.

				*g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets*
g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets
		This is a dictionary variable which uses file types as key.
		If you set the value of a file type entry to 1, this prevents
		loading "neosnippets" directories from 'runtimepath'. This is
		very useful to prevent snippet conflicts between self defined
		snippet files and the built-in snippet files of neosnippet. If
		you use an "_" as key for an entry this will treat the value of
		the entry as default value for all file types.

		Note: This dictionary must be set in your .vimrc.

		For example:
>
		let g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets = {
		\   'c' : 1, 'cpp' : 1,
		\ }

		" which disables all runtime snippets
		let g:neosnippet#disable_runtime_snippets = {
		\   '_' : 1,
		\ }
<
		The default value is {}.

				*g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility*
g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility
		If this variable is not 0, neosnippet will enable the snipMate
		compatibility feature (For example: Filename() function) and
		load |g:snippets_dir| and snipMate snippets automatically from
		'runtimepath'.

		The default value is 0.

g:neosnippet#enable_preview			 *g:neosnippet#enable_preview*
		If this variable is not 0, neosnippet will enable the preview
		window feature in neocomplcache/neocomplete sources.

		The default value is 0.

					 *g:neosnippet#expand_word_boundary*
g:neosnippet#expand_word_boundary
		If it is not 0, neosnippet will expand snippets by a word
		boundary.
		Note: It must be initialized before snippet loading.

		The default value is 0.

						*g:neosnippet#scope_aliases*
g:neosnippet#scope_aliases
		It is a dictionary that associating certain filetypes with
		other snippet files.
		The key is filetype, and the value is comma separated snippet
		filenames excluded extensions.
		It works like |g:snipMate.scope_aliases|.
		The default value is {}. >

		let g:neosnippet#scope_aliases = {}
		let g:neosnippet#scope_aliases['ruby'] = 'ruby,ruby-rails'

g:neosnippet#data_directory			*g:neosnippet#data_directory*
		Specifies directory for neosnippet cache.  If the directory
		doesn't exist the directory will be automatically generated.
		
		Default value is "$XDG_CACHE_DIR/neosnippet" or
		expand("~/.cache/neosnippet"); the absolute path of it.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET SYNTAX					*neosnippet-snippet-syntax*

It is quite easy to create your own snippets. You can use the example below to
get started.

Example:

>
	snippet    [name]
	abbr       [abbreviation]
	alias      [aliases]
	regexp     [pattern]
	options    [options]
	   if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif

The snippet syntax is close to the one of |snipMate|. Each snippet starts with
some keywords that define the name and modify the expansion and treatment of
the snippet.

Snippet Keywords:

- snippet [name] (Required)

	Each snippet starts with the keyword "snippet". This keyword is
	directly followed by the snippet name. The snippet name is used to
	expand the snippet.

- abbr [name] (Optional)

	You can define an abbreviation for the snippet name. It will be
	displayed in the drop down selection menu.

- alias [aliases] (Optional)

	Alias names can be use as additional keywords to expand the snippet.
	You can define multiple aliases using  either spaces ' ' or commas ','
	as separator.

	Example

>
	alias hoge hogera hogehoge
<

- regexp [pattern] (Optional)

	A pattern can be defined via a regular expression. The snippet expands
	only when the expression pattern is matched.

	Example

>
	regexp '^% '
<
	This snippet works same as "options head".
>
	snippet     if
	regexp     '^\s*'
	  if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	  endif
<
- options [options] (Optional)

	Options influence the snippet behavior. The possible values are:

	+ word	This snippet expands by a word boundary.
		Note: To complete the trigger with neosnippet, it must be a
		word character (digits, alphabetical characters or "_").

>
	snippet     date
	options     word
	    `strftime("%d %b %Y")`
<

	+ head	This snippet expands at the beginning of a line only.
		Note: This is the same as "prev_word '^'" which is still
		there for backwards compatibility.

>
	snippet     if
	options     head
	  if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	  endif
<

	+ indent The horizontal position of the snippet will be adjusted
		to the indent of the line above the snippet after expansion.

The snippet itself starts below the part that contains the options, snippet
aliases and keywords, described above. It contains the snippet which gets
expanded which can contain several placeholders. The placeholders are used as
jump points while expanding the snippet. There are several placeholders
available providing different functionality.

The structure of a placeholder can be:

- ${number:placeholder text}

	The placeholder starts with a dollar sign "$". The number of a
	placeholder and the placeholder text are separated by a colon ":".
	They are surrounded by a pair of curly braces "{}". The placeholder
	text is displayed after the snippet expansion and will be replaced by
	your text. If you jump over the snippet and do not insert any text in
	that placeholder position the text remains there. This can be used as
	a default value for a certain position.

	Example

>
	snippet     if
	   if ${1:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif
<

- ${number:#:placeholder text}

	In this kind of placeholder the number is followed by the hash
	character "#".  If you jump over this placeholder and do not insert
	any text, the placeholder text will be removed.

	Example

>
	snippet if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2}
	   endif
<

- ${number:TARGET}

	This is the target placeholder which is replaced by text from a visual
	selection.
	Note: You need to make a visual selection and expand your
	snippet with the key mapping below for this to work.

	|<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_target)|.

	This is very useful if you edit text and decide to put something in an
	environment or some sort of brackets for folding.

	Example

>
	snippet if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2:TARGET}
	   endif
<

- ${number}

	This is a placeholder which you can use as a simple jump position.
	This can be useful if you edit a placeholder inside of some sort of
	brackets or environment and want to go on behind it after that.

	Example

>
	snippet     if
	   if ${1:#:condition}
	     ${2:do}
	   endif

	   ${3}
<

- $number
- ${0}

	This is a synchronized placeholder. Sometimes it is required to repeat
	a value in several positions inside a snippet. If you set the number
	of this placeholder to the same number as one of the other
	placeholders in the snippet, it will repeat its content. $1 is
	synchronized to ${1} and so on. ${0} will be the final jump
	placeholder.

	Example

>
	snippet namespace
	namespace ${1:name} {
	    ${0}
	} // namespace $1
<

	Note: If you like to include characters in snippets that already have
	a special meaning to neosnippet you need to escape them with a
	backslash.

>
	snippet code
	   \`${1}\`${2}

	snippet test
	   ${1:escape \} value}

	# Substitute "\$0" to "$0"
	snippet     main
	options     head
	    if __FILE__ == \$0
		${1:TARGET}
	    end
<

	A placeholder value can not contain new lines. The snippet below is
	not valid.

>
	snippet invalid
	   ${1:constructor: (${2:args\}) ->
	     ${3:# do smth}}
<

Vim has a built-in expression evaluation. You can also use this feature inside
of snippets if you use back ticks like in the example below. Here the "%:t"
gets expanded to the name of the current active file and the current time gets
inserted by expanding the output of the strftime command.

>
	snippet     header
	   File: ${1:`expand('%:t')`}
	   ${2:Created at: `strftime("%B %d, %Y")`}
<

You can also nest placeholders if you escape the special characters.

>
	snippet div
	   <div ${1:id="${2:someid\}"}>${3}</div>${4}
<

In some cases you need to escape the curly brace "}" twice as shown in the
example below.

>
	snippet  catch
	options  head
	    catch ${1:/${2:pattern: empty, E484, Vim(cmdname):{errmsg\\}\}/}
<

This is because ${1:} substitutes the pattern to "/${2:pattern: empty, E484,
Vim(cmdname):{errmsg\}}" and ${2:} substitutes the pattern to "pattern: empty,
E484, Vim(cmdname):{errmsg}"

If you create a snippet file and prepend the filename with a "_" neosnippet
treats the snippets inside the file as global. This means that they will be
available for all file types (e.g _.snip). You can include other snippet files
from within a snippet file with.

>
	include c.snip
<

Or if you want to include a whole directory with file type snippets.

>
	include javascript/*
<

If you include snippet files it can happen that the same snippet name is used
multiple times in snippet files. Neosnippet produces a warning if it detects
this. If you want to overwrite a snippet explicitly, please use:

>
	delete snippets_name
<

After that you can redefine the snippet. But this does not work if you include
external snippet files. There will be no warning when snippets get overwritten.

Multi snippet feature in snipMate is available. Neosnippet substitutes trigger
and descriptions spaces to '_'.

>
	snippet trigger description1
	    hoge
	snippet trigger description2
	    piyo
<

If you use hard-tab for indentation inside a snippet file, neosnippet will use
'shiftwidth' instead of Vim indent plugin. This feature is useful while some
languages' indent files do not work very well (e.g.: PHP, Python).
>
	snippet if
	  if (${1:/* condition */}) {
	      ${2:// code...}
	  }
<

Note: "#{string}" is comment string. But it must be in head.
>
	# It is comment string
	  # It is not comment string!
<

Note: Neosnippet ignores empty or spaces lines in snippet end. If you want to
insert empty line in snippet end, you must insert placeholder.
>
	# This is valid.
	snippet     #!
	abbr        #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	alias       shebang
	options     head
	  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

	  ${0}

	# This is invalid(ignores spaces lines!).
	snippet     #!
	abbr        #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	alias       shebang
	options     head
	  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

==============================================================================
FAQ						*neosnippet-faq*

Q: What if I want to expand a snippet trigger after (, [, " etc...:

A: You should use "options word" in the snippet definition. This changes the
expansion behavior to a word boundary or set
|g:neosnippet#enable_word_expand|.
>
	snippet     date
	options     word
	    `strftime("%d %b %Y")`
<

Q: Why does neosnippet not indent the expanded snippet?

A: You should use "options indent" in the snippet definition. In default,
neosnippet doesn't indent the expanded line.

Q: What if Neosnippet conflicts with |LustyJuggler|.
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2050

A: Please try below settings:
Note: But you must unmap the mappings in select mode manually.
>
	let g:neosnippet#disable_select_mode_mappings = 0
<

Q: Error using snipmate-snippets
Note: snipmate-snippets is currently vim-snippets.
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet/issues/86

A: Please try the setting below. It defines the snipMate function.
>
	let g:neosnippet#enable_snipmate_compatibility = 1
<
Q: Cannot jump over placeholder
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet/issues/120

A: You must use smap in .vimrc.
>
	imap <expr><TAB> neosnippet#expandable_or_jumpable() ?
	\ "\<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_or_jump)" : "\<TAB>"
	smap <expr><TAB> neosnippet#expandable_or_jumpable() ?
	\ "\<Plug>(neosnippet_expand_or_jump)" : "\<TAB>"
<
Because neosnippet uses select-mode to jump over placeholder.

Q: I want to disable preview window in neosnippet candidates.

A:
>
	set completeopt-=preview
<
Q: I want to add snippets dynamically.

A: You can use |:NeoSnippetSource| for it.

Q: I want to delete markers when InsertLeave event.

A: You can use |:NeoSnippetClearMarkers| command. >
	autocmd InsertLeave * NeoSnippetClearMarkers

Q: Why did you separate default snippets from neosnippet core?

A: Because users should choose default snippet collection.
neosnippet has many forks, but almost all forked users change default snippet
files.
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim/network
If splitted default snippets, users can fork and change it easily.
